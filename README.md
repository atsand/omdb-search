This is a small application for a code test. It allows users to search the OMDB api by title.
 
Prompt:
YOUR GOAL: In 4 hours, create a web page using the OMBD API that allows a user to search for a movie. Feel free to start at your designated start time.

OUR GOAL: Verify your skillset matches up with your resume and learn more about how you tackle a new problem.

RULES:
You have 4 HOURS to complete the test (honor system).
At the end of the 4 hours, submit your test via Github or as a zip.
You may use any tech stack you want. – Bonus Points if you do it in our stack (C#, ASP.NET)
You can get as fancy as you want in the time allotted, just be sure to fulfill the basic requirement.

GUIDELINES:
This isn’t a “gotcha” style coding test. We use it to figure the breadth of your skills. For example, we would not expect a junior developer to handle many exceptions, but we would expect a senior developer to handle basic errors like the user submitting no search terms.
If there are any aspects of your test that you didn’t complete, please talk about them in the demo. For example, maybe you started on paginating the search results but didn’t finish—that’s okay! We’d like to see how you would have done it if you had more time.

Stack: Vue 3, Pinia, Vue Router, TailwindCSS, Axios, TS, Vite

Install packages: npm install
Run: npm run dev
